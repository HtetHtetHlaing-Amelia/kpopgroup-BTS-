		<h1>BTS</h1>
		<div class="info">
			BTS is one of the many bands of Korean pop music or more affectionately known as Kpop music. 
Kpop was something that revived pop music when it was dwindling and BTS has a major part in this  renaissance. 
In fact BTS was the band that did the majority of resuscitation. They began their career in 2013 and 
have since then been doling out one successful album after the other, making us wonder about the BTS Albums
 In Order 2013 To 2021. Fans of BTS or the <b>BTS Army</b> will surely know how many albums does BTS have and  
even the BTS Albums In Order 2013 To 2022.

<br><br>But for those who are new or are not familiar this band and its 7 members
Despite early struggles and delayed popularity in South Korea, 
BTS’s international breakthrough was near – in 2018 BTS became
 <b>the first non-English act in over a decade to top the Billboard 200</b>. 
Over time, they have won four Billboard Music Awards, four American Music Awards, 
presented at the <b>GRAMMY</b> awards, and broken a multitude of records, 
including those set by celebrated bands such as The Beatles. <br><br>
Their achievements have not only defied the Western industry’s expectations of non-English acts,
 but they have also helped confront stereotypes associated with East Asian musicians.
 Along with their global endeavors, BTS continues to thrive in the South Korean music industry —
 the group has now won a record-breaking <b>37 Daesangs</b> (grand prizes) and was the first act in history 
to win all of the Daesangs at both the <b>2019 Melon Music Awards and 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards</b>. 
<br>In addition to these successes, the members of BTS continue to embody their own ideas of inclusivity —
 they make frequent donations to charities, participate in UNICEF campaigns to end violence against children,
 and promote lesser-known artists on social media. <br>
