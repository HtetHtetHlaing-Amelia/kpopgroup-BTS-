		<div class="info">BTS debuted on June 13, 2013, as a hip-hop-based group. 
       Tackling the issues of generational divide, mental health, education, and materialism, the band used rap and hip-hop as mediums to express their displeasure with society and connect with youth around the globe. This artistic vision was reflected in their name “BTS,” which stands for the Korean phrase “Bangtan Sonyeondan,” 
translated as “Bulletproof Boy Scouts.”<br>
 Through their music, BTS sought to repel negativity and 
“protect” their generation from societal pressures. BTS’s music has since transitioned to 
adopt a more genre-bending, conceptual style within the framework of hip-hop — one that 
consists of diverse instrumentation, dense lyricism, cinematic music videos, and precise
 choreography — all of which engage audiences through multiple senses 
	and challenge the notion that music is limited to only the sonic space.
<br>
	As expected, this incredible legacy has attracted millions of followers. 
BTS’s diverse fan base, known as ARMY, strives to promote BTS’s positive message 
of self-love and share the group’s artistic vision with the world. The fan base is 
also a social justice force of its own, fighting against the prejudice and xenophobia 
that surrounds non-English-speaking, non-Western artists.<br>

Such organic, fan-driven growth is indicative of BTS’s influence in today’s era of popular 
culture — one that is diverse, global, and participatory. Hence, scholars from all academic 
disciplines and cultural backgrounds wish to study BTS, understand their artistry, and partake 
in this unparalleled period of globalization.
