 <br>Activity is the BTS unit of execution. It holds the environment for an instance of the BTS equivalent of program execution. A process consists of a collection of one or more activities, and is the biggest entity recognized by BTS.<br>

The state of a BTS activity is stored on disk and reinstantiated in memory as required. Typically, it represents one of the actions of a business transaction.<br>

Activities can be hierarchically organized, in a tree structure that may be several layers deep. The activity at the top of the hierarchy is called the root activity . An activity that starts another activity is known as a parent activity . An activity that is started by another is known as a child activity . For example, if activity A starts activity B, B is a child of A; A is the parent of B. Notice that—with the exception of the root activity, which has no parent—an activity can be both a parent and a child.<br>

A process is the biggest entity recognized by BTS. It consists of a collection of one or more activities. It always contains a root activity. When a process is run, the program that implements its root activity receives control. Typically, a process is an instance of a business transaction.<br>

Processes can be categorized, using the PROCESSTYPE option of the DEFINE PROCESS command. All the activities in a process inherit the same PROCESSTYPE attribute. Categorizing processes makes it easier to find a particular process—the BTS browsing commands allow filtering by process-type.<br>

Names and identifiers
You can use a program to define a process. The program gives the process a name, known as its process name , which is used to reference the process from outside the BTS system.<br>
<b>Activation sequences</b><br>
To complete all its work, an activity might need to run as a sequence of separate processing steps, or activations . For example, a parent activity typically needs to run for a while, stop temporarily, and then continue execution when one of its children has completed.<br>
Synchronous and asynchronous activations
You can cause an activity or process to be activated in one of two ways, synchronously or asynchronously.
Lifetime of activities<br>
A child activity is created when its parent issues a DEFINE ACTIVITY command. It is deleted automatically by CICS, either when its parent completes or if the parent issues a DELETE ACTIVITY command against it.
Processing modes<br>
Processing states or modes for activities can be active, canceling, complete, dormant, or initial. These modes describe the current state of an activity.<br>
User sync points<br>
These programs might issue user sync points: a top-level transaction that defines and runs a BTS process, a program that runs as the activation of a child activity, or a program executing outside the BTS environment that acquires a process or activity with an ACQUIRE command.<br>
